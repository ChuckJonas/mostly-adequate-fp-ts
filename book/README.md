# Welcome

This resource is meant to serve as a typescript "companion" resource to Professor [Frisby's Mostly Adequate Guide](https://github.com/MostlyAdequate/mostly-adequate-guide).  
  
Our goal is to take the examples in provided by "Professor Frisby" and translate them to typescript using the `fp-ts` library.  We will provide context on the translations as needed, but we assume you are already comfortable with typescript.

### Using this resource

We will break out a section for each chapter. It's recommended to read the book chapter and then come here to see how the code transposes to `fp-ts`.

Solutions to some exercises can be found in the [github repo](https://github.com/ChuckJonas/mostly-adequate-fp-ts/tree/master/exercises)!
