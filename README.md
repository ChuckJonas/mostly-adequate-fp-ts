# Welcome

This resource is meant to serve as a typescript "companion" resource to Professor [Frisby's Mostly Adequate Guide](https://github.com/MostlyAdequate/mostly-adequate-guide).  
  
My goal is to take the examples in provided by "Professor Frisby" and translate them to typescript using the `fp-ts` library.  I will try to provide as much context as possible on the translations, but I myself and a novice at best \(at the time of starting this guide, I'm only ~ halfway through the book\).

### Using this resource

I will break out a section for each chapter.  I'd recommend reading the Frisby chapter in entirety and then come here to see how the code transposes to typescript using `fp-ts`.
